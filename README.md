# Repo Scope!
We have two iterations here that demonstrate Clojure's two core affordances: concurrency and scalability. The first clip demonstrates two people using the same todo list application (concurrency) at the same time. The second illustrates Clojure's scalability in terms of its compatible with SQL and the Clojure wrapper for React (Reagent).
